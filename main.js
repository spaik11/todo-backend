/*

These functions will greatly simplify things if you want to write them. They are
implementations of map and filter, plus a very simple sort. If you can do them first, they will make the following functions a lot easier, but they aren't super easy
concepts, so if you want to skip them, you can.

They'll also become easier later once you've written a few of the iteration functions and seen how they can be generalized. Those iteration functions in the last section are good practice for writing these!
